## Explanation
When the microphone on the AirPods is enabled, the Bluetooth protocol and the compression protocol is changed from A2DP to HSP, downgrading the audio format from 48 kHz to 16 kHz.

Using  [Audio MIDI Setup](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/audio-midi-setup/welcome/mac) you can this yourself. When the MacBook Pro Microphone is selected as the input device, the AirPods will output at 48,0 kHz:

When the AirPods itself are selected as the input device, they will only output at 16,0 kHz:
